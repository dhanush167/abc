                <p>I experienced one true valley period at the beginning of my
                    freelance career (much like John!) and made a measly $708.75. Instead of giving
                    up, I realized I never wanted to experience a valley like that again, so I decided to
                    build a bridge. This bridge essentially makes me immune to valley periods, so I
                    can focus on climbing those mountains!</p>
